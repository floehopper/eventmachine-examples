## EventMachine example code

I wanted to gain a better understanding of how various bits of EventMachine work. So far the repo includes example code for the following:

* `EventMachine.defer` in [`defer.rb`](blob/master/defer.rb)
* `EventMachine::Deferrable` in [`deferrable.rb`](blob/master/deferrable.rb)
