## EventMachine example code

I wanted to gain a better understanding of how various bits of [EventMachine](https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine/) work. So far the repo includes example code for the following:

* `EventMachine.defer` in [`defer.rb`](./defer.rb)
* `EventMachine::Deferrable` in [`deferrable.rb`](./deferrable.rb)
